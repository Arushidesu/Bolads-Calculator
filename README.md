# Bolads Calculator

A simple calculator made with Python.

Original project taken from [this course](https://www.udemy.com/python-complete/learn/v4/overview).

There are still some issues that need to be addressed. Some that I have identified:
* Typing '0 something' causes an error. Example: 05 + 1
* Enter '.' without being followed by numbers causes an error.
* Pressing enter without typing anything causes an error.
